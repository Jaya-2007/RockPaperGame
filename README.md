##  Project Description

This is a beginner-friendly Java console game where the user plays Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
The game uses numbers instead of strings, making it easy to understand for beginners.
##  How the Game Works

* User enters a number:

  * `1` → Rock
  * `2` → Paper
  * `3` → Scissors
* Computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 3
* The program compares both choices and declares the result:

  * You Win
  * Computer Wins
  * Tie

##  Concepts Used

* Java `Scanner` (user input)
* Java `Random` class
* `if-else` conditions
* Basic console output

##  Sample Output

1 = Rock, 2 = Paper, 3 = Scissors
Enter your choice: 1
Computer choice: 3
You Win!
